# CSLockwood-Portfolio-Site


### Description
This repo is for the UCLA fullstack program bootcamp, module 2. <br>
This is a personal website with a homepage, portfolio, and contact page<br>
The Portfolio features a number of selected projects, and a table of contents that scrolls the page to the corresponding project<br>
The website also can reroute the user to the creator's github profile, or projects listed in the portfolio.<br>
The module 2 assignment provides the following as a guideline and criteria for the assignment:


### User Story
AS AN employer<br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples<br>
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position<br>


### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br>
WHEN I load their portfolio<br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
