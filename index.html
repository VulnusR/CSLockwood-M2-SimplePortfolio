Hello and welcome to my portfolio deployment, my name is Caleb Lockwood and I am a 24 year old aspiring web developer from Los Angeles.
In 2022 I graduated from the University of Califonia, Santa Baraba with a B.A. in Political Science with a concentration in American Politics and an emphasis in Philosophy and Political Theory.
Disillusioned with the state of American politics I decided to make a career change into web development, where I would eventually like to develop IOS applications and comptuer games.
</p>

<p>
I am currently enroled in the UCLA full-stack program where I am learning to get a grasp on the fundementals of web development and coding principles. While I do have some limited prior exerience with HTML from some video games I have played, the vast majority of coding is new to me. Thus far we have learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript, APIs, and other aspects of front end development.
So far I the aspect of front end design that I enjoy making visually appealing UIs; a clean, well-formatted, and "pretty" design for a webpage is always more enjoyable from the user's viewpoint than a bland webpage--irregardless of what or how much information is presented. 
</p>

<p>
In my UCLA course we are currently beginning the fundemental aspects of back-end development working with concepts like node.js. 
Independely, I am working on refining my understanding of front end web design, working with alternate CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS.
