     Hello, my name is Caleb Lockwood and I am a 24 year old aspiring web developer from Los Angeles.
     In 2022 I graduated from the University of Califonia, Santa Baraba with a B.A. in Political Science with a concentration in American Politics and an emphasis in Philosophy and Political Theory.
     Disillusioned with the state of American politics I decided to make a career change into web development, where I would eventually like to develop websites, computer utility software, IOS applications, and just for fun I would like to develop some comptuer games with some programmer & asset creator friends of mine. 
    </p>

    <p>
     I am currently enroled in the UCLA full-stack program where I am learning the fundementals of web development and coding principles. While I do have some limited prior exerience with HTML and R, the vast majority of coding is new to me. Thus far we have learned about both front end and back end development, as well as comptuer science principles.
     At present I particulary enjoy developing UI systems, which so far has been my favorite aspect of web development. In my UCLA course we are currently working on compter sciences principlesto understand how remote and local systems interact with one another. Independely, I am exploring C and C++ mainly but I have also dabbled in the basics of Python. C and C++ particularly interest me because I am currently interested in simple game design--2D models and such. I have some experience with pixel art and sprite design. Once my skills are more up to par with some friends of mine we plan to develop and indie game as a passion project. 
    </p>

    <p>
     My studies with the UCLA full-stack bootcamp progam have been difficult at times but well worth the effort, I have learned so much in the past several months. I understand that this program is only an introduction to the world of programming and that it will take many years of constant practice and study to truly master programming languages, however I am commited to learning and refining my skills. As one expects of a new web developer I spent several hours a day in front of my computer, honing my new craft. It is well worth the effort, and I am commited to keep developing my skills.
